      <h4 class="fw-semibold mb-3">My Development Journey</h4>
      <p>
        BookGenie started as a hands-on project to practically apply what Iâ€™d
        learned about recommendation systems and full-stack development. I began
        by cleaning and preprocessing a real-world book ratings dataset sourced
        from <strong>Kaggle</strong>, removing duplicates and nulls, and
        curating it for meaningful input.
      </p>
      <p>
        To surface highly rated and well-reviewed books, I implemented a
        <strong>popularity-based ranking system</strong> using an IMDb-style
        weighted average. For personalized suggestions, I developed a
        <strong>collaborative filtering model</strong> based on user-book
        interaction similarity, enabling recommendations for users based on the
        behavior of similar readers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I handled the backend using <code>Flask</code>, managing routes, user
        input, and recommendation logic. The UI was crafted with
        <code>Bootstrap 5</code> and custom CSS, prioritizing clarity,
        responsiveness, and real-app structure. Features like error handling,
        flash messages, and modular templates were added to make the app robust
        and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every feature from trending books to recommendation forms was built and
        validated end-to-end, demonstrating my ability to work across the stack
        and think in terms of product quality, not just technical correctness.
      </p>
      <p class="fw-medium">
        BookGenie reflects my practical understanding of recommender systems and
        my ability to build maintainable, user-focused web applications from
        scratch.
